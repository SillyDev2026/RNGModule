RNG Module - Lua Randomness Engine
-----------------------------------

This module provides a robust, flexible random number generation system
designed for games with rarity-based mechanics, such as loot boxes, gacha,
or idle games. It supports advanced features including:

- Rarity-based rolls with customizable tiers and base probabilities.
- Luck modifiers that influence roll outcomes.
- Soft and hard pity rules to ensure fairness over time.
- Entropy and bad luck adjustments to prevent long streaks of poor results.
- Banner multipliers to temporarily boost specific groups of rarities.
- Bulk rolling with automatic count tracking.
- Expected roll calculations to estimate how many rolls are needed for each rarity.
- Chance text output for displaying probabilities in a readable format.
- Dry streak tracking for rarities or tiers.
- State resetting to start fresh when needed.

Key Types:
- RarityDef: Defines a rarity with Tier, Base chance, and optional Group.
- PityRule: Optional soft and hard pity configuration.
- BannerRule: Optional group multiplier configuration.
- RNGState: Tracks the engine state including total rolls, last rarity, entropy, and failures.
- RollResult: Represents the result of a roll with Rarity and Tier.

Main Functions:
- RNG.new(config): Create a new RNG engine with rarities, pity, and banners.
- RNG.newState(seed): Initialize a new state for the engine.
- roll(state, luck?): Roll once with optional luck modifier.
- bulk(state, rolls, luck?): Perform multiple rolls and get counts by rarity.
- getExpected(luck?): Get base probabilities for all rarities considering luck.
- getChanceText(luck?): Returns a formatted string of probabilities.
- getNextRollChances(state, luck?): Returns normalized probabilities for the next roll.
- getExpectedRollsFor(state, rarity, luck?): Expected number of rolls to get a specific rarity.
- getExpectedRollsText(state, luck?): Text listing expected rolls for all rarities.
- getDryStreak(state, rarity): Returns number of rolls without a specific rarity.
- getTierDryStreak(state, tier): Returns number of rolls without a specific tier.
- resetState(state): Resets the RNG state completely.

This module is designed to be flexible and extensible, making it ideal for
implementing fair, predictable, and enjoyable random reward systems in Lua-based games.

example
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService('ReplicatedStorage')
local RNGModule = require(Replicated:WaitForChild("RNGModule"))
local rarities = {
	Common = {Tier = 1, Base = 0.5},
	Uncommon = {Tier = 2, Base = 0.3},
	Rare = {Tier = 3, Base = 0.15},
	Epic = {Tier = 4, Base = 0.045},
	Legendary = {Tier = 5, Base = 0.005}
}

local engine = RNGModule.new({Rarities = rarities})
local state = RNGModule.newState()

for i = 1, 20 do
	local r = engine:roll(state, 1)
	print(r.Rarity, r.Tier) -- RarityName, Tier that is what prints out
end
prints smth like this
  Common 1 (x2)
  Uncommon 2
  Common 1 (x4)
  Uncommon 2
  Common 1
  Rare 3
  Epic 4 (x2)
  Uncommon 2
  Common 1 (x3)
  Uncommon 2 (x2)
  Rare 3
  Common 1
